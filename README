This is a play and dismiss project.

Why?

- I needed to have something to do in my, in between projects. 
And wanted to get some knowledge about Java SMF.

What?

- I created a program that monitors a specific folder on your harddrive, 
and when files a dropped into the folder, the file is checked and if it is a
known file type, the program does what it is programmed to do with that specific filetype. 

How?
- Works on Windows, not sure about Linux.
- The Runner class starts up a Monitor, when files are found, it gives control to a control class,
that then again will route the control to the filehandler action class.
